# iRacing Safety Car Generator

This program is designed to trigger safety car events in iRacing with more control than the built-in automatic cautions, with adjustable settings.

**Note:** This software is still in very early development, so there may be bugs and issues. Please avoid using it in critical applications (i.e. leagues with cash prizes), where reliable performance is essential.
